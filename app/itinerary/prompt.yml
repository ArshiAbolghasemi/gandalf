    Create a detailed travel itinerary for {destination} spanning {duration_days} days.
    Each day should have a theme and at least 2 activities with specific times, descriptions, and locations.
    Include practical tips and make the itinerary culturally rich and realistic.

    IMPORTANT: If '{destination}' is not a real, valid travel destination, return null for the itinerary   field. Only create an itinerary for legitimate, real places that tourists can actually visit.
